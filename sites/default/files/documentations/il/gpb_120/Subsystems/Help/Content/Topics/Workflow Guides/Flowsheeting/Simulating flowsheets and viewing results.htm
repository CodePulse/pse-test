Instead, the execution output it can be used to view and obtain results for the simulation. On the topology, certain unit models may also appear with a red hue.

                <h4>Stream analysers</h4>
                <p>Stream analysers are unit models that can be inserted into streams on the flowsheet to report additional results. These unit models have to be inserted into the streams prior to running the simulation to be able to obtain molar compositions and flowrates for that stream as well as additional desired properties such as phase fractions and compositions, densities and transport properties. There are stream analysers for the 'gMLMaterial', 'gMLMaterial_reversible' and 'gMLEnergy connection-types'. These unit are all contained in the 'gML&#160;Basics' library and can be included in a flowsheet model by dragging them from the library onto the flowsheet.</p>
                <div class="example" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Example&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Example</b></span></span>
                    <p>Open the "Flash separation.gPJ-PB" example project and navigate to the flowsheet. Click on the connection (line) between valve "v1"&#160;and the sink "gas_product" and press the <span class="keyName">DELETE</span>-key to delete it. From the "gML Basics" library drag a "Stream_analyser_gML" unit onto the flowsheet canvas, name it "sa1" and position it between valve "v1" and sink "gas_product". Connect its inlet to the outlet of valve "v1" and its outlet to the inlet of sink "gas_product".</p>

                <h3>Trajectory browser</h3>
                <p>All the results for the simulation are contained in the case file. By clicking on the folder 'Trajectories' in the case file, the values of all the variables contained in the flowsheet model can accessed. When the trajectories folder is expanded a list of all the units in the flowsheet model appears. The key variables for each unit can be found by expanding the folder for the individual unit models and then expanding the 'REP' folder that is inside. A list of all key variables for the unit model appears. Double-clicking on a variable opens a window in the work area with the results for that variable. By toggling between the 'Table'&#160;and 'Graph' tabs at the bottom of this window, the data can be represented both as (a series) of value(s) or as a graph.</p>

                <h3>Exporting by copy and pasting</h3>
                <p>The simplest way to export a limited amount of results is to simply copy and paste them from <span class="ProductName">gPROMS ProcessBuilder</span> into another application, such as, Microsoft Excel. Tables, for each variable in the trajectory browser, can be copy and pasted, by selecting a range of cells in them (or using <span class="keyCap">CTRL+A</span> to select all data for that variable) and using <span class="keyCap">CTRL+C</span>&#160;and <span class="keyCap">CTRL+V</span> in another application.</p>
                <p>Data from stream tables can also be exported in the same way. Alternatively, an entire stream table can be copied by right-clicking in the stream table and selecting 'Copy stream table' from the context menu.</p>

                <h3>Exporting to CSV</h3>
                <p>When the results for a larger number of variables needs to be exported or the same variables need to be exported multiple times for multiple simulation runs of the same flowsheet model, it is more convenient to define data to export to a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file format. This file can then be opened by another application, such as Microsoft Excel, for further processing. </p>
                <p>To export to CSV, right-click on the 'Trajectories'&#160;folder (or any folder contained within the 'Trajectories' folder), and select 'Export'&#160;from the context menu. Select 'Comma separated value (.csv) result file' in the menu that pops up. </p>

                <p>When the desired variables have been selected, clicking the 'Export' button will cause these variables to be exported to a CSV file. The 'Save settings....' button can be used to save the current selection of variables. This is useful if more simulations, for the same flowsheet model, need to be run and for each run the same variables need to be exported. This selection can then be loaded and applied for a subsequent simulation by using the 'Load settings...' button. </p>
                <p>The variables are exported to a CSV&#160;file in a stacked format. In MS&#160;Excel the PivotTable functionality can be used to construct 2 dimensional tables from the data.</p>

Then, for the source model and each of the sink models, select only the "Mass flowrate" variables. Optionally, click "Save settings" to save the chosen selection for use in future simulations. Click on 'Export' and specify a CSV file.</p>
                    <p>Open Microsoft&#160;Excel and open the exported CSV file. Select all the data in the table with the 'VARIABLE', 'TIME' and 'VALUE' headers by clicking on the cell with 'VARIABLE', holding SHIFT+CTRL and pressing right and down arrow keys.
