        <h1><a name="AEN2121"></a>Using Output Channels in gPROMS</h1>
        <p>Three standard Output Channel components are distributed with gPROMS. These are dynamic shared libraries implementing the Output Channel
 Interface. The first is gRMS, which is a general result management system that allows the user to display simulation results quickly in the form of 2D
 and 3D graphs. gRMS is described in detail in the section on the gRMS Output Channel.
 The second is gPLOT, which outputs simulation results to a text file. gPLOT is described in the section on the gPLOT Output Channel. The Microsoft Excel Output Channelis based on Microsoft Excel, making use of the facilities it
 provides for the storage and display of results. Currently the Microsoft Excel Output Channel is only available on Microsoft Windows operating systems
 and is described in detail in the section on the Microsoft Excel Output
 Channel.</p>
        <p>In addition to the three standard Output Channels, it is also possible for users to provide and use their own results handling option. This can
 be done by developing a dynamic shared library that implements the OCI.</p>
        <p>A gPROMS Process may use the four results handling options either separately or in any combination. The desired option may be switched on by
 specifying the appropriate parameters in the corresponding Solutionparameters. An
 example of the syntax used for this purpose is shown below:</p><pre class="programlisting">SOLUTIONPARAMETERS
 gRMS := ON ;
 gPLOT := OFF ;
 gExcelOutput := ON ;
 gUserOutput := ON ;</pre>
        <p>Each option may be activated or deactivated by specifying the ON and OFF switches respectively. By default the gRMS Output Channel is switched ON
 and all other channels are switched OFF.</p>
        <p>If an Output Channel is switched ON, then the set of results generated by the execution of a Process will, by default, be identified by the name
 of that Process. On the other hand, the user also has the option of specifying a different name by which the results of the Process simulation will be
 identified. An example of such a specification is shown below:</p><pre class="programlisting"># process entity "Simulate1"
 ...
 SOLUTIONPARAMETERS
 gRMS := "StartUpSimulation" ;
 gPLOT := ON ;
 SCHEDULE
 ...</pre>
        <p>Here the results will be stored in a gRMS archive called StartUpSimulation.gRMS and a gPLOT ASCII file called Test.gPLOT. In all cases,
 specifying a results name against an Output Channel in Solutionparameters automatically switches this channel ON.</p>
        <p>The specified Output Channel components will be searched by gPROMS at the start of Process execution in the following order:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>in a sub-directory called "oc" of the user's current gPROMS working directory. This sub-directory is at the same level as the "input",
 "output" and "save" sub-directories.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>in a sub-directory called "oc" of the gPROMS system installation directory (specified by the GPROMSHOME environment variable).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The three pre-built Output Channel components have fixed class names corresponding to the channel options. The dynamic shared libraries for the
 three standard channels (gRMS.so and gPLOT.so for Unix systems, gExcel.DLL and gPLOT.DLL for Windows) are normally installed in the "oc" sub-directory
 of the gPROMS system installation directory. The user-developed component is usually placed in the user's own gPROMS "oc" sub-directory. Installing it
 in the gPROMS system directory will usually require system administrator's privileges.</p>
        <p>The default class name for the user-provided Output Channel component is gUserOutput. Thus gPROMS will search for a dynamic shared library called
 gUserOutput.so (for Unix systems) or gUserOutput.DLL (for Windows). However, the default class name can be overridden by specifying it before the
 results identification name, with the two being separated by two consecutive colons. Thus, the specification:</p><pre class="programlisting">SOLUTIONPARAMETERS
 gUserOutput := "WonderPlotter::StartUpSimulation" ;</pre>
        <p>will cause gPROMS to search for an Output Channel component in a dynamic shared library called WonderPlotter.so (for Unix systems), or
 WonderPlotter.DLL (for Windows) and, assuming it loads it successfully, to communicate with it a set of results to be identified as
 StartUpSimulation.</p>
