        <h1><a name="MDG_BuildingSchedule"></a>Building a Schedule</h1>
        <p>There are two main ways to build a Schedule: using the graphical interface or by entering gPROMS language. The former is by far the most
         convenient and is described here. The gPROMS language for Schedules is covered in the following sections, describing the Tasks in detail.</p>
        <p>To begin building a Schedule, one must first create a Process. Let's assume one already exists, which contains all of the specifications for the
         simulation apart from the Schedule; that is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Units are defined,</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Parameters have all been Set,</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Variables have been Assigned to take up any degrees of freedom and</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Initial conditions have been specified</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>so that the simulation can be initialised. All that remains is to define what should happen during the simulation and when. For example, one can
         fill a reactor, heat it up, keep the temperature constant while the reactions take place, cool it down and finally empty it. These actions are defined
         by specifying changes in Assigned Variables and periods of uninterrupted simulation, all by using elementary Tasks.</p>
        <p>Before these Tasks can be placed into the Schedule, we must first create a Schedule. To do so, double-click on the Process to open it in the
         gPROMS editor window. There are four tabs in the Process window: Schedule, Solution parameters, gPROMS language and properties. The gPROMS language tab
         contains all of the code that defines the elements of the Process listed above. The code for the Schedule will be placed at the end, in a
            <code class="methodname">SCHEDULE</code> section. The graphical interface is shown in the Schedule tab. These two views are shown below.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="AEN5470"></a>
            <div class="mediaobject">
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_LanguageTab_NoSchedule.png" />
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="FigureCaption"> gPROMS language tab with no Schedule</p>
        </div>
        <div class="figure"><a name="AEN5477"></a>
            <div class="mediaobject">
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_ScheduleTab_NoSchedule.png" />
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="FigureCaption"> Schedule tab with no Schedule</p>
        </div>
        <p>To create the Schedule using the graphical interface, a Task needs to be dragged from the Task Palette onto the Schedule window. Therefore, one
         must first click on the Palette tab in the Project tree. If the Palette tab is not visible, then it can be enabled by selecting
            <b class="guimenuitem">Palette</b> from the <b class="guimenu">View</b> menu or by pressing <b class="keycap">CTRL</b>-<b class="keycap">F11</b>. The Task Palette is shown below.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="AEN5490"></a>
            <div class="mediaobject">
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_ScheduleTab_NoSchedule_WithPalette.png" />
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="FigureCaption"> Task Palette</p>
        </div>
        <p>The Task Palette is divided into two panes: the top pane contains all of the available Tasks (arranged in four categories) and the bottom pane
         contains an explanation of the currently-selected Task. The four cetegories of Task are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p><a href="x6199.html">Composite Tasks</a>, which combine elementary tasks and specify the manner in which they are executed
                     (sequentially, concurrently, conditionally or iteratively);</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p><a href="x5897.html">Elementary Tasks</a>, which are used to specify external disturbances to the systems (e.g. changing the values
                         of simulation input variables, specifying periods of undisturbed operation etc);</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p><a href="x6368.html">Foreign Process Tasks</a>, which control the way the results are displayed (but do not affect the results
                             themselves); and</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p><a href="c6586.html">Predefined Tasks</a>, which are user-defined reusable Tasks that contain a segment of an
                                 operating procedure.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To expand a category, simply left click on its title or on the <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_TaskPalette_ExpandButton.png" /> symbol next to it. All of the available Tasks will then be shown. Left clicking
                         on a task will display further information about it in the window at the bottom of the palette. Left clicking on the category title again or on the
                            <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_TaskPalette_CollapseButton.png" /> symbol will collapse the category.</p>
        <p>To create the Schedule, left click on a Task and, while holding the left mouse button down, drag the Task onto the Schedule window. Before the
                         mouse button is released, the mouse pointer will change to <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_ScheduleTab_MousePointer_Copy.png" />
                            to indicate that the task will be copied into the Schedule. When the mouse button is released, the Schedule is created and the Task is placed into the
                         Schedule. Most Tasks, however, need to be configured before they can be added to the Schedule; in these cases, a configuration dialog will appear and
                         it must be completed before the Task is added.</p>
        <p>This is demonstrated in the following example. Suppose we only want to simulate the Process for a given amount of time, without changing any of
                         the input specifications. This is done with the Continue Task. Since the Continue Task instructs gPROMS to simulate the Process for a given amount of
                         time (or until a certain condition is satisfied), this time (or condition) must be specified before the Task can be added to the Schedule. The figure
                         below shows the Schedule and Task configuration dialog just after the Task had been dragged onto the Schedule window and the left mouse button
                         released.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="AEN5520"></a>
            <div class="mediaobject">
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_ScheduleTab_ContinueConfig.png" />
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="FigureCaption"> Continue Task configuration dialog</p>
        </div>
        <p>Configuration dialogs automatically check syntax, so this one initially states that the configuration will only be complete when a time value is
                         entered in the first text box or a logical condition is entered in the second one. It is also possible to enter values in both boxes and the two
                         conditions will be combined with an AND or OR logical operator, which can be selected using the radio button. In this case, it is disabled because both
                         text boxes are empty. Once the configuration is complete, the <b class="guibutton">OK</b> button will be enabled and left clicking on this will complete
                         the addition of the Task to the Schedule. This is shown in the figure below. (Left clicking on the <b class="guibutton">Cancel</b> button will cancel the
                         addition of the Task, but will leave a blank Schedule in the Schedule window (visible just above the configuration dialog).)</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="AEN5530"></a>
            <div class="mediaobject">
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_ScheduleTab_ContinueOnly.png" />
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="FigureCaption"> Continue Task in a Schedule</p>
        </div>
        <p>Notice also that by left clicking on the Continue Task, the bottom pane of the Task Palette has been populated with an overview of the Continue
                         Task. The scroll bar on the right can be used to scroll through the text and the size of the pane can be adjusted by dragging the divider up or
                         down.</p>
        <p>When a Task is added to the Schedule using the graphical interface, the gPROMS language is automatically added to the Process, as can be seen in
                         the language tab below. The Schedule could have been created by typing this code into the Process and the same graphical Schedule would have been
                         generated automatically.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="MDG_GraphicalSchedules_Editor1"></a>
            <div class="mediaobject">
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_LanguageTab_ContinueOnly.png" />
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="FigureCaption"> Continue Task in a Schedule (gPROMS language tab)</p>
        </div>
        <p>Returning to the Schedule tab, it can be seen that the Schedule itself is represented in the graphical interface. It contains a black vertical
                         line above and below the Continue Task. These lines are "hot spots" where additional Tasks can be added. In a blank Schedule (as seen in the screen
                         shot showing the Task configuration dialog), there is just one black line and therefore only one place where a new task can be added. Once a Task has
                         been added, a new one can be added before or after the first one, by dragging a new Task onto one of the lines.</p>
        <p>The Continue Task displays the gPROMS language resulting from the specification made in the configuration dialog. In this case, the number 10 was
                         entered in the first text box, specifying that gPROMS should simulate the Process for 10 units of time and then stop. It is possible to hide the
                         details of any Task by left clicking on the <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_ScheduleTab_CollapseTaskButton.png" /> symbol on the
                         left (the details can be shown again by pressing on the <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_ScheduleTab_ExpandTaskButton.png" />
                            symbol). This allows the user to customise how much detail is shown in the graphical view: as can be seen in the <a href="#">screen shot above</a>, Tasks can be nested within other Tasks such that a complex hierarchy can be built up
                         and it may not be desirable to see all of this detail all of the time. For this screen shot, the details of the Parallel Tasks were hidden so that the
                         whole of the Schedule was visible in the editor. To save space, gPROMS will also only show the first 4 lines of code associated with a Task. An
                         ellipsis (…) is used to indicate that some information is not being shown. There are three ways to see the details: 1. double click on the Task to
                         bring up the configuration dialog; 2. view the Task language by right clicking on the Task and selecting <b class="guimenuitem">Go to language</b> from
                         the context menu; or 3. move the mouse pointer over the Task and hold it there until a tool tip appears showing the details. You can also adjust the
                         width of the Task boxes by pressing one of the four buttons shown below (see also the <a href="x5858.html">Schedule Tab
                         Toolbar</a>).</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="AEN5553"></a>
            <div class="mediaobject">
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_ScheduleTab_Toolbar_WidthControls.png" />
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="FigureCaption"> Width Controls</p>
        </div>
        <p>The first three limit the width of the Task boxes to small, medium and large. The last one removes the limit so that the Task boxes will be as
                         wide as the longest visible line of language. The currently-selected option is indicated by the depressed button (the second one in the case above). In
                         the <a href="#">screen shot above</a>, it can be seen that the boxes are too narrow to show all of the lines for
                         some of the tasks and this is indicated by the ellipsis at the end of the line (in the While and Parallel tasks).</p>
        <p>Any Task can be selected by left clicking on it. Once selected, a Task can be deleted by pressing the <b class="keycap">DEL</b> key or by right
                         clicking and selecting <b class="guimenuitem">Delete</b> from the context menu. The Task can also be copied or cut using the context menu. It may be
                         pasted into the Schedule by right clicking on one of the black lines and selecting <b class="guimenuitem">Paste</b>. <i class="emphasis">Note that if you delete
                         a Composite Task, then all of the Tasks that it contains will also be deleted.</i> Pressing the <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_UndoButton.png" /> button or <b class="keycap">CTRL</b>-<b class="keycap">z</b> will undo any changes made to the Schedule, including the deleting of Tasks. (Pressing the <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_RedoButton.png" /> button or <b class="keycap">CTRL</b>-<b class="keycap">y</b> will redo any changes that have been undone.)</p>
        <p>Tasks can also be reconfigured by double-clicking on them. This will open the Task Configuration dialog, allowing the details of the Task to be
                         modified.</p>
        <p>The context menu also provides another way of adding a new Task to an existing Schedule. Right clicking on a black line activates the context
                         menu, which contains sub menus for each of the built-in Tasks: Composite, Elementary and Foreign Process. So to add a new Task using this method, right
                         click on a black line, open the appropriate menu and left click on the Task you want to insert. The result is identical to dragging from the Task
                         Palette: if necessary, a configuration dialog will appear and then the Task will be inserted in the chosen place.</p>
        <p>So far, the Schedule we have created is very simple. Most Schedules will be more complex than this, and they may include many Tasks, some
                         occurring after others have finished, some occurring concurrently with others and some Tasks may need to be performed iteratively or only if some
                         condition is met. These structures can be created by using the <a href="x6199.html">Composite Tasks</a> that have been mentioned briefly before.
                         The Composite Tasks section of the Task Palette contains the four Tasks that allow Schedules of arbitrary complexity to be built. These are:</p>
        <div class="mediaobject">
            <p>
                <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_TaskPalette_Composite.png" />
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>Each of these Tasks can be dragged onto a hot spot in the Schedule and they then provide locations for more Tasks to be added. These Tasks will
                         be described in more detail later (see: <a href="x6199.html">Composite tasks</a>). For now, we shall focus on the Sequence Task as the principles
                         covered here apply to all of the above.</p>
        <p>Let us proceed with the example given so far. We currently have just one Task in the Schedule: a Continue Task. Suppose that after the 10 units
                         of time, we want to change the value of one of the input Variables. This can be done with the Reassign Task, and so all that need be done is to drag a
                         Reassign Task onto the hot spot below the Continue Task. (Alternatively, we could right-click on the hot spot and choose
                            <b class="guimenuitem">Reassign</b> from the <b class="guisubmenu">Add elementary task</b> context menu.</p>
        <p>The result of the insertion is shown below (after the Reassign task has been configured – how to do this will be described in the <a href="x5920.html">Reassign section</a>).</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="AEN5591"></a>
            <div class="mediaobject">
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_ScheduleTab_ContinueReassign_lrg.png" />
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="FigureCaption"> Schedule after a Reassign task was inserted</p>
        </div>
        <p>The first thing to notice is that a Sequence Task has automatically been inserted into the Schedule. This is because if two or more Tasks are to
                         be performed in series, they must be enclosed in a Sequence Task. To save always having to insert the Sequence Task before adding elementary Tasks
                         (such as the Continue and Reassign Tasks here) gPROMS will always insert a Sequence Task if one is needed. This means that you can drag
                            <i class="emphasis">any</i> Task onto <i class="emphasis">any</i> hot spot and the resulting Schedule will always be valid.</p>
        <p>Next, we have changed to width of the Task boxes to show all of the details of the Reassign Task. Here, the Reassign Task changes the value of
                         the <code class="varname">Plant.Reactor.STR.flow_Lin</code> Variable to 50.</p>
        <p>The automatically-generated gPROMS language now looks like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">SCHEDULE
  SEQUENCE
    CONTINUE FOR 10
    REASSIGN
    Plant.Reactor.STR.flow_Lin := 50;
    END
END</pre>
It would have been easy to type this into the gPROMS language tab, but larger more complex Schedules (with all four types of
                         Composite Task being nested in complex arrangements) become harder to follow in this view and this method is therefore more prone to error. The
                         graphical view is much easier to follow and to modify, particularly if one wants to move or copy Tasks from one place to another, as we shall
                         demonstrate now.<p>The Schedule currently does nothing new: although the <code class="varname">Flow_Lin</code> variable changes value, gPROMS stops the simulation immediately
                         afterwards. To see the effect of the change in flowrate, we must add another Continue Task. If we add one after the Reassign Task and set it to
                         simulate for 20 time units, we will have the following.</p><div class="mediaobject"><p><img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_ScheduleTab_ContinueReassignContinue_lrg_cropped.png" /></p></div><p>Now suppose that we want to see what would happen if we started the simulation by Continuing for 20 units, Reassigning the
                            <code class="varname">Flow_Lin</code> Variable and then Continuing for 10 units of time. We could just double click on the first Task and change its value to 20
                         and then do the same for the third task, but a quicker and easier way to swap these Tasks over is to move them. To move a Task, left click on it and,
                         while holding the left mouse button down, drag it to another hot spot. Before the left mouse button is released, the mouse pointer will change to
                            <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_ScheduleTab_MousePointer_Move.png" /> to indicate that the Task is being moved. Note, this is
                         similar to the pointer when a Task is being added, but without the "+" sign. When the left mouse button is released, the Task will be moved to the new
                         location (note that Tasks cannot be moved if the new location requires the addition of a new Sequence Task – in this case, one must either insert a new
                         Sequence and then move the Task or copy the Task and then delete the original one). Using this method, it is very quick and easy to move Tasks
                         around.</p><p>It is also possible to copy Tasks. This is done in a similar way to moving Tasks but by also holding down the <b class="keycap">CTRL</b> key. To copy
                         a Task, drag it to a new hot spot exactly as if it were being moved. The mouse pointer will change to <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_ScheduleTab_MousePointer_Move.png" /> to show that it is being moved. Now, before releasing the left mouse
                         button, hold down the <b class="keycap">CTRL</b> key. The mouse pointer will now change to <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_ScheduleTab_MousePointer_Copy.png" /> to indicate that the Task is being copied. Keeping the
                            <b class="keycap">CTRL</b> key down, release the left mouse button and the duplicate Task will be added to the Schedule. gPROMS will insert a new Sequence
                         Task if necessary. You can change a copy to a move or <i class="emphasis">vice versa</i> at any time during a drag: all that matters is the state of the
                            <b class="keycap">CTRL</b> key when the left mouse button is release.</p><p>If you prefer not to drag Tasks around, it is also possible to move or copy Tasks using the <b class="guimenuitem">Cut</b>,
                            <b class="guimenuitem">Copy</b> and <b class="guimenuitem">Paste</b> commands in the <b class="guimenu">Edit</b> and context menus or their keyboard
                         shortcuts (<b class="keycap">CTRL</b>-<b class="keycap">x</b>, <b class="keycap">CTRL</b>-<b class="keycap">c</b> and <b class="keycap">CTRL</b>-<b class="keycap">v</b> respectively). Simply right click on the Task, select <b class="guimenuitem">Cut</b> or <b class="guimenuitem">Copy</b> from the context
                         menu, then right click on the desired hot spot and select <b class="guimenuitem">Paste</b>. To use the keyboard shortcuts, left click on the Task,
                         press <b class="keycap">CTRL</b>-<b class="keycap">x</b> or <b class="keycap">CTRL</b>-<b class="keycap">c</b>, left click on the desired hot spot and press <b class="keycap">CTRL</b>-<b class="keycap">v</b>. (The currently-selected hot spot is shown as a blue line instead of a black one.)</p><p>It is possible to move, copy or delete multiple Tasks simultaneously. This is done by making multiple selections. To make a multiple selection,
                         select the first Task as usual (by left clicking on it), then hold down the <b class="keycap">CTRL</b> key and select another Task. As long as the
                            <b class="keycap">CTRL</b> key is held down, more Tasks can be added to the selection by left clicking on them. (Note that Tasks cannot be removed from the
                         selection by left clicking on them again.) There is one restriction when making multiple selections: once the first Task is selected, you can only add
                         more Tasks to the selection if those Tasks belong to the same Composite Task as the first one and at the same level in the Task hierarchy. The Schedule
                         below (which is a modified version of the Batch Plant example) will be used to illustrate this.</p><div class="figure"><a name="AEN5654"></a><div class="mediaobject"><p><img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_ScheduleTab_MultipleSelections.png" /></p></div><p class="FigureCaption"> Schedule with example multiple selections</p></div><p>The Continue Task at the top and the large Parallel Task can both be part of the same multiple selection because they are both part of the first
                         Sequence Task. All of the other Tasks are also within the main Sequence Task, but because they are deeper in the hierarchy, they cannot be selected
                         along with the first Continue Task.</p><p>The two While Tasks can form a multiple selection because they both belong to the large Parallel Task.</p><p>The two small Parallel Tasks cannot form a multiple selection because, even though they are at the same level in the hierarchy, they belong to
                         different Sequence Tasks.</p><p>Finally, if we select the <code class="varname">MonitorWast …</code> Task, we can also select the <code class="varname">ReplenishFee…</code> Task and the Sequence
                         next to it, but neither the <code class="varname">FillReactor …</code> Task (wrong level) nor the <code class="varname">MonitorProdu…</code> Task (not in the same
                         Parallel).</p><p>Once a multiple selection has been made, it can be moved, copied or deleted just like a single Task. To delete all of the Tasks in a multiple
                         selection (including any Tasks contained within them), simply press the <b class="keycap">DEL</b> key or right click and select
                            <b class="guimenuitem">Delete</b> from the context menu. To move or copy, make sure the <b class="keycap">CTRL</b> key is held down and then left click and
                         drag one of the Tasks to its new location. Releasing the left mouse button while <b class="keycap">CTRL</b> is still held down will result in a copy;
                         releasing the <b class="keycap">CTRL</b> key first will result in a move. Releasing <b class="keycap">CTRL</b> and pressing <b class="keycap">ESC</b> while the Tasks
                         are being dragged cancels the move/copy and retains the multiple selection.</p><p>When the Tasks in the multiple selection have been moved or copied, they will be pasted into the new location in a specific order. First, if they
                         are not copied or moved to a Sequence Task, then one will be inserted automatically and they will be inserted into that. Next, they will be inserted
                         into the Sequence Task in the order that they had in their original Composite Task. That is: if they were originally in a Sequence Task, then their
                         time order will remain the same; if they were in a Parallel Task then the order from left to right in the Parallel Task will become the order from
                         first to last in the Sequence; finally, if they were in an If Task then the Task in the <code class="methodname">TRUE</code> branch will be inserted before
                         the Task in the <code class="methodname">ELSE</code> branch.</p><p>Just as with any other edit made to the Schedule, a completed move or copy of a multiple selection can be undone by pressing <b class="keycap">CTRL</b>-<b class="keycap">z</b> or the undo button.</p><p>We have seen that when most Tasks are added to the Schedule, a configuration dialog appears. This is because most Tasks need some information to
                         function. In the case of the Continue Task, we needed to specify an amount of time and/or a condition. We also saw that the Reassign Task needs to know
                         which Variables to Reassign and the new values that they should take. Since different Tasks require different data, each configuration dialog will be
                         different. These are discussed in detail in the sections that describe the Tasks. There are, however, some common features that can be described
                         first.</p><p>The two features that are common to a lot of Task configuration dialogs are real-time syntax checking and the Advanced view.</p><p>All Task configuration dialogs constantly check for errors in the input data. Whenever the data would prevent the Task from working correctly,
                         the <b class="guibutton">OK</b> button is disabled forcing the user to correct the error (or provide the minimum amount of data) before the Task can be
                         inserted or amended.</p><p>The Reassign Task requires a list of Variables and values to assign to them. When first inserted into the Schedule, the list is empty as is shown
                         in the screen shot below.</p><div class="figure"><a name="AEN5689"></a><div class="mediaobject"><p><img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_ScheduleTab_TaskConfig_ReassignNew.png" /></p></div><p class="FigureCaption"> Initial configuration dialog</p></div><p>The Reassign Task is allowed to contain an empty list of Variables, so there is no error shown and the <b class="guibutton">OK</b> button is
                         enabled. To add a new Variable, click on the &lt;new&gt; text, enter the path of a Variable and press <b class="keycap">RETURN</b>. The path will be checked
                         to make sure it is valid, as shown below.</p><div class="figure"><a name="AEN5699"></a><div class="mediaobject"><p><img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_ScheduleTab_TaskConfig_ReassignError.png" /></p></div><p class="FigureCaption"> Configuration dialog with illegal Variable path</p></div><p>As the path is incorrect, the dialog reports an error and disables the <b class="guibutton">OK</b> button. If a syntactically valid path is
                         entered, but the Variable does not exist, gPROMS gives a warning instead and enables the <b class="guibutton">OK</b> button. This is because one might
                         want to define this Variable after adding the Task.</p><div class="figure"><a name="AEN5709"></a><div class="mediaobject"><p><img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_ScheduleTab_TaskConfig_ReassignWarning.png" /></p></div><p class="FigureCaption"> Configuration dialog with legal but undefined Variable path</p></div><p>This warning is also shown in the graphical Schedule:</p><div class="figure"><a name="AEN5717"></a><div class="mediaobject"><p><img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_ScheduleTab_WarningInSchedule.png" /></p></div><p class="FigureCaption"> Warnings are shown on the graphical Schedule</p></div><p>If the Schedule is entered using gPROMS language tab, then syntax errors can occur and they will also be shown in the graphical Schedule (using a
