        <h1><span class="ProductName">gPROMS FormulatedProducts</span> libraries</h1>
        <p> <span class="ProductName">gPROMS FormulatedProducts</span> consists of four libraries covering shared models such as sensors and controllers, active ingredient manufacture, solids processing and product manufacture and product performance. All of these libraries are interoperable with one another and, as such, maybe used on the same flowsheet. Within each of these libraries is a number of sub-modules containing the model libraries. These sub-modules are described in more detail in <a href="x4.htm" class="MCXref xref">'Model libraries'</a>.</p>
        <h2>gFORMULATE&#160;1.0 Libraries</h2>
        <p>The gFORMULATE libraries contain the building blocks of the model libraries. They also contain the shared models that may be used at many points in the library such as sensors, controllers and analysers. There are also some basic unit operation models such as a tank, agglomerator and fan.</p>
        <p>The most commonly used models in this library are the sources and sinks as these define where material enters and leaves the process.</p>
        <p>All the other libraries depend on the gFORMULATE libraries and as such they should always be open.</p>
        <h2>gFORMULATE&#160;1.0 - Synthesis &amp;&#160;Fluid Separation</h2>
        <p>gFORMULATE Synthesis &amp; Fluid Separation Libraries contain the reactor models (stirred tank and plug flow) as well as flash drum models for two-phase and three-phase flash calculations.</p>
        <p>These libraries are new to gPROMS&#160;FormulatedProducts.</p>
        <h2>gFORMULATE&#160;1.0 - gCRYSTAL</h2>
        <p>gFORMULATE 1.0 gCRYSTAL modules contain models for crystallization processes including MSMPR crystallizer, wet mills and a plug flow crystallizer model. This library contains the ported models from the legacy gCRYSTAL libraries as well as the new models described previously.</p>
        <h2>gFORMULATE&#160;1.0 - gSOLIDS</h2>
        <p>Models for solids processing are found in the gSOLIDS library. Different routes of drug product manufacture can be described using these models. There are models for roller compaction, continuous blenders for direct compression, spray drying, wet granulation and tabletting.</p>
        <h2>gFORMULATE&#160;1.0 - gCOAS</h2>
        <p>gCOAS contains libraries for pharmacokinetics, in-vivo and in-vitro product performance as well as property tools to perform analyses such as speciation analysis. There are also supplementary in-vivo models that can be found within the gCOAS library folder (they will not open directly from the "Open/close libraries" dialog).</p>
