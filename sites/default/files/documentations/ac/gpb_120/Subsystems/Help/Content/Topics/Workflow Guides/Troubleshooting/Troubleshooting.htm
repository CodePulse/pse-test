            <div class="MCDropDownBody dropDownBody">
                <p>Troubleshooting is an integral part of constructing complex models. Errors made during the construction of the flowsheet model typically manifest themselves when an attempt is made to simulate the flowsheet model. It may fail to simulate for one or more of the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1"> it is an incorrect model of the physical process that has no solution</li>
                    <li value="2">there is no physical solution to the problem or specification trade-offs have been made that are not feasible</li>
                    <li value="3">the solution does exist but the flowsheet model has been incorrectly set up </li>
                    <li value="4">the solution does exist but <span class="ProductName">gPROMS ProcessBuilder</span> is unable to produce this solution</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For more complex models it can be difficult to distinguish between these causes of failure or to find in which part of the flowsheet model an error has been made. Mistakes can be made during the construction of the flowsheet model in the values that are entered and the selections made in dialogs of unit models.&#160;These may range from specifying certain quantities in the wrong units of measurement, imposing conditions on the model outputs that are infeasible to omitting required specifications.</p>
                <p>Even if the model is formulated correctly, it may be set up in such a way that the solution algorithm will have difficulty finding a solution. Examples of this are, failing to insert a recycle breaker unit (see <a href="../Flowsheeting/Flowsheets with recycles.htm" class="MCXref xref">'Flowsheets with recycles'</a>) in a recycle stream or providing incorrect initial guess values for recycle streams.</p>
                <p>Even if the flowsheet model has been set up correctly, <span class="ProductName">gPROMS ProcessBuilder</span> may be unable to solve the problem. This might be the case for complex flowsheets or when physical properties packages used in the flowsheet model are not able to produce properties for intermediate solutions (of the flowsheet model solution algorithm).</p>
                <p> The gPROMS&#160;language (see <a href="../Custom modeling/Custom modeling.htm" class="MCXref xref">'Custom modelling in gPROMS ProcessBuilder'</a>) can be used to modify correlations in gML&#160;models, to construct custom unit operation models or to formulate overall process KPI's. Incorrect use of the gPROMS&#160;language may also be a source of errors.</p>
                <p>In many instances, information provided in the "Execution output" window can be used to analyse a failing simulation. This tutorial provides an overview of the steps to follow in order to analyse information in the "Execution output" window and to resolve errors.</p>
                <div class="tip" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Hint&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Hint</b></span></span>
                    <p>Because debugging of complex models of chemical processes can be difficult, it is often good to construct the flowsheet model incrementally and simulate it at every step to verify that the model can be solved and that realistic output is produced. Each incremental step can be saved to disk as a separate project or, when using a version control system, as a separate revision.</p>
                    <p>When this approach is adopted, and a failure does occur, an efficient strategy to find the problem is to compare the current version of the model with a previous version that was working as intended. The built-in compare tool can be used to compare flowsheet models and processes. The compare tool can be accessed using <span class="guimenu">Tools</span> -&gt; <span class="guimenuitem">Compare</span>.  When specifications, in dialogs, have been changed it is good practice to compare the process entities for both versions of a project.</p>

                <p>Before attempting to run a simulation, make sure that there are no errors or warnings displayed on the problem panel that appears during flowsheet construction. These errors or warnings will generally result in failure during the simulation. To check the problem panel, double-click on the flowsheet model in the project tree. If there are any errors or warnings, these will be shown in the bottom panel. To correct errors and warnings, click on the error or warning in the problem panel. The topology window will be centred on the unit model for which the warning or error is flagged up. Change the port connections or information entered on the dialog for the unit model to correct the error. </p>

                <p>The execution output window shows information related to the solution of the flowsheet model. This solution is performed in a number of stages that are executed in sequence. If all the stages are completed successfully, a solution is obtained.</p>
                <p>For a steady-state flowsheet, the process will contain the following stages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Correctness check of the model formulation</li>
                    <li value="2">Simulation license check</li>

                    <li value="6">Convergence of the unit model equations at the start of the flowsheet initialisation procedure</li>
                    <li value="7">Flowsheet initialisation procedure to obtain the desired solution</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For dynamic simulation there are two additional stages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Time integration of the flowsheet model equations</li>
                    <li value="2">Re-convergence of the flowsheet model equation upon encountering a discontinuity</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To solve a problem that leads to a simulation failure, first determine during which stage of the solution process the problem occurs. In the execution output window, the error message is, typically, the last message before the simulation ends. Look for the execution messages, at the start of each stage, and determine whether or not they are followed by an error message before the start of the next stage.</p>

                    <p>It is possible to search for the text of an error message in the execution output. To do this, select <span class="guimenu">Tools</span> -&gt; <span class="guimenuitem">Search and replace</span> or press <span class="keyCap">F11</span>. A window will appear at the bottom of the screen and a search string can be entered. After pressing 'Search' all the instances of the string in the execution output will be shown.

                <h3>Correctness check of the model formulation</h3>
                <p>During this stage, checks are performed that verify that every variable, that is referred to, actually exists. In addition it is checked that there are no errors made in the gPROMS&#160;language or the simulation schedule. Error messages, displayed for problems during this stage, often explicitly state the nature of the problem. These problems are therefore generally simple to resolve.</p>
                <h3>Simulation license check</h3>
                <p>Running a simulation generally requires a license. Prior to execution a simulation, a check is made that this license is available. The execution of a simulation, of a flowsheet model involving gML&#160;unit models, generally requires the following licenses:</p>

                    <li value="1">general simulation activity license </li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Resolution of the model parameters</h3>
                <p>Prior to constructing a system of equations, all the parameters in the model are calculated. Parameters have a fixed value that does not change during a simulation.  For problems during this stage, see <a href="Resolution of the model parameters.htm" class="MCXref xref">'Resolution of the model parameters'</a></p>
                <h3>Initialisation of foreign objects</h3>
                <p>A flowsheet model simulation uses unit models that are primarily written as equations in the gPROMS&#160;modelling language. However, flowsheet model simulations generally also rely on calculations performed by compiled code, whether this code is a part of <span class="ProductName">gPROMS ProcessBuilder</span> or provided by an external program. These pieces of code are known to <span class="ProductName">gPROMS ProcessBuilder</span> as <span class="concept">foreign objects</span>. For example, a physical property package is accessed as a foreign object.</p>
                <p>When a simulation is started these programs are instantiated. This instantiation can fail for different reasons. It may be that definition string, for that foreign object, is incorrect either because it points to a foreign object file that does not exist or options, passed for that foreign object, are incorrect. Additionally, a program accessed as a foreign object may require its own license. If this license is unavailable the foreign object will not initialise. Each external program may generate its own error messages. Study these messages to resolve the problem with the instantiation.</p>

                    <p>The foreign object that links to the Multiflash physical property package fails to initialise. On closer inspection of the execution output it appears that the "WATER_RKS" file cannot be opened. Comparing the file "WATER_RKS.MFL"&#160;which is imported into the project (see <a href="../Specifying process materials/Specifying process materials.htm" class="MCXref xref">'Specifying process materials'</a> on how to specify property packages) with the "WATER_RKS"&#160;file that is displayed, it appears that the file extension has been omitted. </p>

                <h3>Constructing the system</h3>
                <p>A flowsheet model consists of a number of mathematical equations which are solved together for a number of variables. At this stage this system is constructed. </p>
                <p>A problem that can occur during this stage is that some variables that are arrays are indexed out of their bounds. This typically arises because invalid selections have been made in unit models in which variables are selected from "Bus" connections. A possible cause is that, at first, a unit model that selects a variable from a "Bus" connection is connected to a certain unit operation model which includes this variable. Next, the unit model is connected to a different unit operation model for which the selected variable is invalid, but the selection is not updated.</p>

                <p>This type of problem can be difficult to correct on large flowsheet as no indication is given to which unit model on the flowsheet the error pertains and no warning is given in the problem panel. To identify the unit model causing the error, check unit models in which selections are made from "Bus" connections, for orange borders around selections. These indicate that the selection is not current for that model. To correct this, update the selection to select a variable from the dropdown list.</p>

                <h3>Degree of freedom analysis</h3>
                <p>After the system of equations has been constructed, some checks are performed to determine whether or not the system of equations is valid. This referred to as a "degree of freedom analysis". There are a number of problems that may results in a system of equations not being valid. Typically these arise from either making too many specifications for variables, or not enough specifications. See <a href="Degrees of freedom problems.htm" class="MCXref xref">'Degrees of freedom problems'</a> for a detailed overview of problems that can occur during this stage and how to resolve them.</p>
                <h3>Solving the unit models</h3>
                <p>When the system of equations for the flowsheet model is valid, an attempt can be made to solve this system of equations. For steady-state, flow-driven, problems the first stage in solving these equations is to solve the equations for each unit model in the flowsheet. The unit models are solved in sequence. See <a href="Solving the unit models.htm" class="MCXref xref">'Solving the unit models'</a> for a detailed overview of problems that can occur during this stage and how to resolve them.</p>
                <h3>Solving the flowsheet</h3>
                <p>After a solution has been found for individual unit models, a solution will be sought for the complete flowsheet including recycles and specification trade-offs. See  <a href="Solving the flowsheet.htm" class="MCXref xref">'Solving the flowsheet'</a> for a detailed overview regarding which problems can occur during this stage and how to solve these.</p>
