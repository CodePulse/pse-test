        <h1><a name="modelsthatinvolvephysicalpropertycalculations"></a>Using Models incorporating physical property calculations</h1>
        <p>We have seen how physical property calculations can be incorporated within Models, being provided by external physical property packages.
 However, before these Models can be used to perform, say, a simulation of a given process, some additional information relating to physical properties
 needs to be specified.</p>
        <p>Consider, for example, the Foreign Object PPP used in the example.</p><pre class="programlisting">1 # model entity "Flash"
 
 2 PARAMETER
 3 PPP AS FOREIGN_OBJECT "Multiflash"
 4 NoComp AS INTEGER
 5 Mw AS ARRAY(NoComp) OF REAL
 
 6 VARIABLE
 7 F, L, V AS MolarRate
 8 Hf AS MolarEnergy
 9 Q AS EnergyRate
10 T AS Temperature
11 P AS Pressure
12 x, y, z AS ARRAY(NoComp) OF MoleFraction
 
13 SET
14 NoComp := PPP.NumberOfComponents ;
15 Mw := PPP.MolecularWeight ;
 
16 EQUATION
17 F*z = L*x + V*y ;
18 F*Hf = PPP.LiquidEnthalpy(T,P,L*x) + PPP.VapourEnthalpy(T,P,V*y) + Q ;
19 x*PPP.LiquidFugacityCoefficient(T,P,x) = 
20 y*PPP.VapourFugacityCoefficient(T,P,y) ;
21 SIGMA(x) = SIGMA(y) = 1 ;
22 ...</pre>
        <p>We already know that the methods (e.g. LiquidFugacityCoeffient) of this Foreign Object will be provided by an external physical property package
 called "Multiflash''. However, for these methods to be fully defined, we also need to know the set of components that are involved in the mixture under
 consideration and also the particular type of thermophysical model (e.g. the equation of state or activity coefficient model) that will be used to
 compute these properties. All of this information is associated with the specific Foreign Object instance PPP. Indeed, two different instances of the
 same Foreign Object class within the same gPROMS simulation may involve different component sets and/or use different thermophysical property
 calculation options.</p>
        <p>We note that the above information is not actually directly used by gPROMS as it relies entirely on computations provided to it by the external
 physical property package. In fact, most modern physical property packages provide their own mechanism for the specification of the above information.
 Typically, this takes the form of a text file conforming to a proprietary format. The file can be constructed and edited using either a text editor or
 a graphical user interface provided by the package.</p>
        <p>As we have seen in: Foreign Object values and their specification, the value
 of an instance of a Foreign Object is a string of characters that gPROMS passes to the external software to allow it to create this instance. In the
 case of physical property Foreign Objects, this string typically corresponds to the name of the proprietary file that contains the information
 mentioned above.</p>
        <p>The value of an instance Foreign Object is specified in the Set section of either a Model or a Process entity. Here, we provide some examples of
 such specifications.</p>
