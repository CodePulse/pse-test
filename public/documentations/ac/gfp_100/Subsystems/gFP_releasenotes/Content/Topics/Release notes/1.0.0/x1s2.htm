        <h1>New unit operations</h1>
        <p>There are a number of new unit operations in <span class="ProductName">gPROMS FormulatedProducts</span>. Some of the main new additions are described below. Examples of all these models can be found within the installation examples of <span class="ProductName">gPROMS FormulatedProducts</span>.</p>
        <h2>Stirred Tank Reactor</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Unit operations/cstr two phase liquid.svg" />
        </p>
        <p>The stirred tank reactor can be found in the library project gFORMULATE Reactors of the Synthesis &amp;&#160;Fluid Separation library. This model describes liquid phase reactions in a well-mixed tank. One or more reactions can be simulated according to Arrhenius kinetics, and multi-phase systems can be considered, taking into account mass transfer between liquid phases. This unit operation can be used in either batch or continuous modes. An example of the stirred tank reactor can be found in the installation examples.</p>
        <h2>Plug flow reactor</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Unit operations/pfr two phase liquid.svg" />
        </p>
        <p>The plug flow reactor can be found in the library project gFORMULATE Reactors of the Synthesis &amp;&#160;Fluid Separation library. This model describes a continuous reaction process in which material flows along the axial direction. Material flow is described by convection-dispersion equations, while reaction kinetics are modelled similarly to those in the stirred tank reactor. One or more liquid phases can be considered, allowing for bi-phasic reactors to be modelled with proper evaluation of mass transfer kinetics. An example of the plug flow reactor can be found in the installation examples.</p>
        <h2>Plug flow crystallizer</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Unit operations/pf crystallizer.svg" />
        </p>
        <p>The plug flow crystallizer can be found in the library project gCRYSTAL Crystallizers. This model describes a continuous crystallization process in which material flows along the axial direction. Material flow is described by convection-dispersion equations, while crystallization kinetics are modelled similarly to those in the MSMPR crystallizer.</p>
        <h2>Wet mill</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Unit operations/wet mill.svg" />
        </p>
        <p>The wet mill, found in the library project gCRYSTAL Wet Mills, describes the size reduction of crystal particles suspended in a liquid medium.  Among other phenomena, this model takes into account the impact of the liquid and solid states as well as the operation of the impeller on breakage, growth and dissolution of the particles.</p>
        <h2>Continuous blenders</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Unit operations/horizontal blender.svg" /> <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Unit operations/vertical blender.svg" /> <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Unit operations/feed frame.svg" /></p>
        <p>A set of three different unit operations representing continuous blending is included in gPROMS FormulatedProducts. The three models include a feed frame, horizontal blender and vertical blender. The horizontal and vertical blenders can be found in the gSOLIDS Continuous Blenders library, and the feed frame is included in gSOLIDS Tableting. These models describe a plug flow motion of solid particles through the vessel with the ability to include dispersion effects. Surface adhesion effects are also considered.</p>
        <p>The vertical tank fills and empties depending on the inlet and outlet flow; the fill level at any point during a simulation is indicated graphically on the icon. The feed frame can be connected to a composition sensor where acceptable limits of concentration of a component in the outlet flow can be set – this icon will turn green when the outlet flow is within the limits and red when outside the limits.</p>
        <h2>Twin screw granulator</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Unit operations/twin screw granulator.svg" />
        </p>
        <p>The twin screw granulator unit operation is found in the gSOLIDS Granulators - Twin Screw library. This model describes a continuous wet granulation process in a twin screw extruder. A wet granulate phase is produced as liquid binder is added to a fine powder feed. The mechanisms of drop nucleation, breakage, consolidation, and layering are considered, and product attributes such as granule size distribution, fraction of ungranulated fine powder, moisture content, and porosity are reported. A compartmental approach is taken to describe the screw elements, their configuration, and material transport. Once validated, this model can be used to analyse the effects of screw element configuration on product attributes.</p>
        <h2>High shear granulator</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Unit operations/high shear granulator.svg" />
        </p>
        <p>The high shear granulator unit operation is found in the gSOLIDS Granulators - High Shear library. This model describes a wet granulation process in a well-mixed, high shear mixer. A wet granulate phase is produced as liquid binder is added to fine powder. The mechanisms of drop nucleation, wetting, layering, agglomeration, breakage, and consolidation can be considered, and product attributes such as granule size distribution, fraction of ungranulated fine powder, moisture content, and porosity are reported.</p>
        <h2>Screen mill</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Unit operations/screen mill.svg" />
        </p>
        <p>The screen mill unit operation, from the gSOLIDS Dry Mills library, models the continuous milling of solid particles where the material in the unit is classified by a screen; undersize material is removed from the unit and oversize material remains in the mill until it is micronized to the screen aperture size or smaller. Various options are available to handle nonidealities in screening behaviour. If the unit overfills due to slow breakage rates then the material will begin to overflow the mill.</p>
