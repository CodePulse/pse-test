        <h1><a name="MDG_IntrinsicTasks_Control"></a>Controlling the Use of Intrinsic Tasks</h1>
        <p>So far, the examples on Intrinsic Tasks have assumed that these Tasks should always be enabled for <i class="emphasis">every</i> instance of
 a Model containing Intrinsic Tasks. Although this is the default behaviour, one can easily select which Model instances should have their
 Intrinsic Tasks enabled. There are a number of ways to achieve this.</p>
        <p>First, all Intrinsic Tasks can be switched off by editing the process properties. In this case, no matter what specifications are made in
 the Models and Process, no Intrinsic Tasks will be used and the user will have to specify the use of Tasks manually. To do this, open the
 Process entity and left click on the Solution Parameters tab. Double click on (or click on the "+" symbol next to) the <tt class="guilabel"><b>Intrinsic
 Tasks</b></tt> folder. Now you can change the setting from <tt class="guilabel"><b>ON</b></tt> to <tt class="guilabel"><b>OFF</b></tt> by clicking on
      <tt class="guilabel"><b>ON</b></tt> and selecting <tt class="guilabel"><b>OFF</b></tt> from the list.</p>
        <div class="mediaobject">
            <p>
                <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_SolParam_GUI_IntTasksOFF.png" />
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>Finer control over the use of Intrinsic Tasks can be achieved by defining their use whenever a Model is instantiated. To do this, the
      <tt class="guilabel"><b>Intrinsic Tasks</b></tt> solution parameter of the Process must be <tt class="guilabel"><b>ON</b></tt>. Then, there are three options for
 instantiating a Model (<code class="varname">A</code> is the name of a Model defined in the gPROMS project):</p><pre class="programlisting">UNIT
 A AS A
 A_off AS A INTRINSIC_TASKS OFF
 A_on AS A INTRINSIC_TASKS ON</pre>
        <p>These three specifications work as follows.</p>
        <p>Instantiating a model with the INTRINSIC_TASKS OFF option forces gPROMS not to use any of the Intrinsic Tasks defined for that Model
 instance.</p>
        <p>In contrast, instantiating a Model with the INTRINSIC_TASKS ON option turns on all Intrinsic Tasks for the Model instance.</p>
        <p>Finally, if no specification is made (the first example above), then the behaviour of the Model instance will be the same as the Model
 instance within which it is contained. If it is a top-level model instance, then the default behaviour is for the Intrinsic Tasks to be enabled.
 So, the behaviour of a particular Model instance will be passed down the Model hierarchy until an explicit instantiation takes place, which will
 then override the behaviour of the parent Model.</p>
        <p>To illustrate the behaviour of Models (and sub Models) instantiated in this way, let us assume that the three Model instances of Model
      <code class="varname">A</code> are made in a Process. Model <code class="varname">A</code> then contains three instances of a Model <code class="varname">B</code>:</p><pre class="programlisting">UNIT
 B AS B
 B_off AS B INTRINSIC_TASKS OFF
 B_on AS B INTRINSIC_TASKS ON</pre>
        <p>Finally, Model B also contains three different instances of Model C:</p><pre class="programlisting">UNIT
 C AS C
 C_off AS C INTRINSIC_TASKS OFF
 C_on AS C INTRINSIC_TASKS ON</pre>
        <p>This then produces the following Model-instance hierarchy.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="AEN6900"></a>
            <div class="mediaobject">
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_IntrinsicTask_Propagation.png" />
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="FigureCaption"> Illustration of Intrinsic Task control</p>
        </div>
        <p>The ticks and crosses next to each Model instance indicate whether or not intrinsic tasks are enabled for that Model instance. Since the
 default behaviour for top-level Models is for Intrinsic Tasks to be enabled, <code class="varname">A</code> and <code class="varname">A_on</code> both have their
 tasks enabled. Therefore, each of the Model instances within <code class="varname">A</code> will have the same properties as those within
      <code class="varname">A_on</code>. The main feature is that the <code class="varname">*_on</code> instances always have Intrinsic Tasks enabled,
      <code class="varname">*_off</code> instances are always disabled and the instances with the default specification always behave as the Model instance
 above.</p>
        <p>gPROMS also allows the these specifications to be made via the graphical interface. Click on the Topology tab and then right click
 on the Unit you want to specify. The context menu contains an item called <tt class="guilabel"><b>Intrinsic Tasks…</b></tt>. Moving the mouse over this
 item, enables a list containing the three possible settings for the Unit. Left clicking on one of these options sets the value for this Unit.
 Units with disabled Intrinsic Tasks are indicated by a red cog image on the Unit; those with enabled Intrinsic Tasks by a green cog; and if the
 default specification is made, no cog is shown. If you then switch back to the gPROMS language view, you will see that the code has changed to
 reflect the choice made. An example of a Unit with enabled Intrinsic Tasks is shown below.</p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="AEN6916"></a>
            <div class="mediaobject">
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/MDG_IntrinsicTask_EnabledIcon.png" />
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="FigureCaption"> Example of a Unit with enabled Intrinsic Tasks</p>
        </div>
        <p>To reiterate, control over which Model instances use Intrinsic Tasks can occur only when the Process solution parameter
      <tt class="guilabel"><b>Intrinsic Tasks</b></tt> is <tt class="guilabel"><b>ON</b></tt>; if it is <tt class="guilabel"><b>OFF</b></tt>, then none of the Intrinsic Tasks are enabled
 and they must be included explicitly in the Schedule.</p>
