        <h1><a name="usingphysicalpropertiesforsimplematerials"></a>Using Physical Properties for Simple Materials</h1>
        <p>Most non-trivial process models make use of physical properties, such as density, enthalpy and fugacity, all of which are typically functions of
 temperature, pressure and composition. The accuracy of estimation of these physical properties is one of the most critical factors in determining the
 accuracy of the model predictions.</p>
        <p>In principle, physical property calculations may be coded as Equations within gPROMS Models. However, this is not practical for all but the
 simplest methods of computing physical properties. It may also be unnecessary in view of the wide range of general and reliable physical property
 calculation packages that are currently available.</p>
        <p>This chapter describes how you can incorporate physical properties within your Models. The actual computation of these physical properties is
 performed by external physical property software that is interfaced to gPROMS.</p>
        <p>gPROMS defines a minimal set of physical properties that any external package interfaced to it should provide, as well as the precise form of these
 properties. These are listed in: <a href="x280.html">The set of physical properties supported by gPROMS</a>. We
 strongly recommend that you use these and, if possible, <i class="emphasis">only</i> these physical properties in any Models that you write. In this way,
 you will be able to use your Models with any physical property package that adheres to the standard gPROMS protocol.</p>
        <p><a href="x755.html">Incorporating physical properties in Models</a> describes how precisely you can refer to
 the above physical properties in any Models that you write. This is done by treating the external physical property software as a Foreign Object
 interfaced to gPROMS and providing services to it. You will find that a basic understanding of Foreign Object concepts is very helpful in making the most out of incorporating physical properties in Models.</p>
        <p>Then a description is given on how one can use <a href="x815.html">Models that involve physical property
 calculations</a>. The Models can be written by yourself or by others.</p>
        <p>In addition to defining a standard protocol for interacting with physical property packages, interfaces to two such packages are already available
 to be licensed and used with gPROMS. The special characteristics of these interfaces are described in: <a href="x866.html">Multiflash physical property interface</a> and <a href="gSAFT introduction.htm">gSAFT
 physical property interface</a>.</p>
        <p>gPROMS supports the <a href="x1680.html">CAPE-OPEN thermodynamics standard</a>. This allows the use of external
 physical properties software complying to this standard within gPROMS Model entities.</p>
        <p>This chapter is concerned with physical property calculations of simple mixtures of molecular species existing in liquid and vapour phases.
 Physical properties for more complex materials (such as electrolytic systems) are considered in the next chapter on <a href="c2796.html">using physical properties for complex materials</a>. However, we recommend that you read and
 understand the present chapter <i class="emphasis">before</i> proceeding to the next chapter.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in interfacing a different physical property package to gPROMS, then you need to read the chapter entitled "Interfacing
 Physical Property Packages to gPROMS" in the "gPROMS System Programmer Guide" <i class="emphasis">after</i> you have read and thoroughly understood this
 chapter.</p>
