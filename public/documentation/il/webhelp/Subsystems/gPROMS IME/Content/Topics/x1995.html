        <h1><a name="executionoutput"></a>Execution output</h1>
        <p>Once the necessary license is obtained, <span class="ProductName">gPROMS ModelBuilder</span> creates an execution output window which displays all the messages relating to the
 solution of the Model-based activity. During this execution, the user can interact with the executing activity by right clicking on this window,
 which causes the execution interaction menu to appear. While the execution is actually proceeding, the menu has two main options that are
 enabled:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>The <b class="guimenuitem">Abort immediately</b> option stops the execution at the earliest convenient stage and releases the
 license. No further interaction with this Model-based activity is possible.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>The <b class="guimenuitem">Stop execution, retain model</b> option also stops the execution at the earliest convenient stage. However, the
 license is retained, and this allows the user to interact further with the executing activity via additional options in the execution interaction
 menu that become enabled at this stage, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">
                        <p><b class="guimenuitem">Query variable</b> allows the examination of the information available on a particular variable specified by its
 number as this is reported during the numerical solution;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="2">
                        <p><b class="guimenuitem">Query block</b> allows the examination of the information available on a particular block specified by its
 number as this is reported during the numerical solution. This option is only available when BDNLSOL is used as the non-linear solver and the
 block reported corresponds to the block in last initialisation/re-initialisation of the activity before it is stopped;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="3">
                        <p><b class="guimenuitem">Query equation</b> allows the examination of the information available on a particular equation specified by its
 number as this is reported during the numerical solution;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="4">
                        <p><b class="guimenuitem">Query unit</b> allows the examination of the information available on a particular UNIT specified by its
 complete pathname;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="5">
                        <p><b class="guimenuitem">Create problem report</b> creates a report on all parameters, variables and equations in the Model, including their values, and
 incorporates this under the "Results" category of the current Case for later inspection or archiving;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="6">
                        <p><b class="guimenuitem">Create saved variable</b> set creates a gPROMS saved variable set using the current values of all variables; it
 then incorporates this under the "Results" category of the current Case.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="7">
                        <p><b class="guimenuitem">Release license</b> releases the license and essentially aborts the activity execution; no further interaction
 is possible with it.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>All the options listed above available after <b class="guimenuitem">stop execution, retain model</b> can also be performed once the activity
 has stopped automatically (whether it has failed or completed successfully) if the <tt class="guilabel"><b>Release model after execution</b></tt> option was not
 selected in the case configuration dialog at the start of the activity.</p>
        <p>It is worth noting that (when in multiple windows mode) closing the execution output window by clicking on the X button at its top right corner
 does not cause the activity execution to be aborted or interrupted. In fact, the activity proceeds as before and all messages issued by it continue
 to be recorded within the Case. The execution output window can be made to re-appear at any time simply by double-clicking on the <tt class="guilabel"><b>Execution
 Output</b></tt> entry in the Case sub-tree.</p>
